# Handling Massive Proportion of Missing Labels in Multivariate Long-Term Time Series Forecasting 
Training Deep Learning (DL) models with missing labels is a challenge in diverse engineering applications. Semi-supervised learning approaches have been proposed to try to address this problem, but their performance is affected with Massive Proportion of Missing Labels (MPML). This paper presents a strategy for Handling MPML in Multivariate Multi-Step Time Series Forecasting with Uncertainty. First, a set of samples of the possible interpolation of the missing outputs are generated by the Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR) based in the domain knowledge. Second, a dependent aggregation is performed varying the training data with the combination between observed inputs features and the obtained samples set (interpolated labels) from GPR. The obtained datasets are used to train different DL models and the outputs of them are combined to compute the uncertainty (confidence interval) in the forecast. We evaluated our approach with the development of a soft-sensor with two real datasets (one with MPML) to forecast the biomass of Adeno-Associated Virus production in bioreactors. Our experimental results demonstrate the potential of the strategy through quantitative evaluation of the generated forecasts in a real case that would be extremely difficult to train a DL model due to MPML.
